The game that will be created will consist of four varied mini-games. Each game will have a gameover screen and a winning screen. Each game will have different objectives. The four games will be Pong, Soccer, a shooting gallery, and a maze.

Pong will be a two player game where each player has their own side of the screen with a paddle that they can control using two keys on the keyboard. A ball will start in the middle of the screen and begin to move to one side. The player must intercept the ball with their paddle to send it to the other side of the screen. If one player misses the ball and it passes the screen, the other player gets a point. Once a point is scored, the ball reappears in the middle of the screen and a new point starts. First to five points wins.

The maze game will have a player goes through a maze with an initial velocity and an increasing acceleration.  If the player touches any of the walls of he game, then they lose. If a player successfully goes through the maze,they increase to the next level.There will be three levels to the game. After the player successfully completes all three levels they will have won the game. There is no score keeper or limit to tries.

The soccer game will be a game where a player will control a soccer player whose goal will be to get a soccer ball into a goal defended by a moving goalie. A score will be kept and there will be a finite number of lives. As the player increases their score, the speed of the goalie will increase. The player will win the game when they reach a score of ten. 

The Shooting Gallery game will be a game that gives the player a shooter as they view a background of targets.  It's their job to shoot at the right time in order to hit a target. Each time they hit a target, their score increases. Each time they mistakenly hit an incorrect target, their lives decrease.
